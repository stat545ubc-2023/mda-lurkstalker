# Tongshuai Zhang' Mini Data Analysis [Stat-545A-MDA-01](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-1/) and [Stat-545A-MDA-02](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-2/)

## Repository Description

This repository showcases the preliminary results from our Mini Data-Analysis project. My focus has been on the 'vancouver_trees' dataset, offering insights into the multifaceted nature of Vancouver's tree environment. I've delved into the distribution of tree species across different neighborhoods, analyzed planting patterns over distinct time frames and areas, and provided several other noteworthy findings. For details, check the mda-project-d1.md and mda-project-d2.md files.
